# Sprint Challenge: JavaScript Fundamentals

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a survey of problems. This Sprint explored JavaScript Fundamentals. During this Sprint, you studied array methods, this keyword, prototypes, and class syntax. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by completing a survey of JavaScript problems.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in JavaScript fundamentals.

> You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Description

You will notice there are several JavaScript files being brought into the index.html file.  Each of those files contain JavaScript problems you need to solve.  If you get stuck on something, skip over it and come back to it later.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, you should have a console full of correct responses to the problems given.

## Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your team lead

1. Briefly compare and contrast `.forEach` & `.map` (2-3 sentences max)

.forEach() does not return a new array and does not need a return statement, it must go through the whole array without stopping, and do what is requested. .map() does return a new array and you must use a return statement, it copies the original array and then manipulates the copied array.

2. Explain the difference between a callback and a higher order function.

Higher order functions recieve callback functions as arguments. Callback functions are put into higher order functions as arguments.

3. What is closure?

Closure is when a function reaches outside of it's scope into a parent function's scope to get information that it needs, usually a variable. 

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

Window Binding: if no other rules apply, "this" keyword defaults to the window unless you are in strict mode, then it will return undefined. 

Implicit Binding: when a function is invoked, the left of the dot (.) is where it can find what it's looking for - this is what the "this" will be referring to 

Explicit Binding: forces a function to use a certian object as its "this". It is applied by using .call(), .bind(), and .apply()
- .call(): immediately invokes the function and you pass arguments in individually
- .bind(): returns a new function that is a copy of the original and can be invoked later, and you pass arguments in individually
- .apply(): immediately invokes the function and you pass in the arguments as an array

New Binding: "this" refers to a newly created Object; if a function is invoked with a constructor function, the "this" keyword refers to the newly created Object. You can either pass arguments in individually or as a single object.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
We need super(), because it works with extend to do what .call() and Object.create() do when using the prototype method - they make a copy of the function and any attributes or functions associated with the copied function.

### Task 1 - Project Set up

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:
Make sure you clone the branch that the TK links to: the vnext branch, NOT master!

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add TL as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of Repo (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new Branch on the clone: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Create a pull request before you start working on the project requirements.  You will continuously push your updates throughout the project.
- [ ] You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE
- [ ] Implement the project on your Branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.



### Task 2 - Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

**Pro tip for this challenge: If something seems like it isn't working locally, copy and paste your code up to codepen and take another look at the console.**

#### Task A: Objects and Arrays

Test your knowledge of advanced array methods and callbacks.
* [ ] Use the [arrays-callbacks.js](challenges/arrays-callbacks.js) link to get started.  Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task B: Closure

This challenge takes a look at closures as well as scope. 
* [ ] Use the [closure.js](challenges/closure.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task C: Prototypes

Create constructors, bind methods, and create cuboids in this prototypes challenge.
* [ ] Use the [prototypes.js](challenges/prototypes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task D: Classes

Once you have completed the prototypes challenge, it's time to convert all your hard work into classes.
* [ ] Use the [classes.js](challenges/classes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

In your solutions, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Task 3 - Stretch Problems

There are a few stretch problems found throughout the files, don't work on them until you are finished with MVP requirements!

## Submission Format

Follow these steps for completing your project:

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo).
- [ ] Add your team lead as a Reviewer on the Pull-request
- [ ] TL then will count the HW as done by  merging the branch back into master.
